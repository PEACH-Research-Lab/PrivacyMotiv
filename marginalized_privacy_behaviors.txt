Privacy response and cost
1. Apathy
- Response: Lack of response to privacy threats
- Cost: Exposure to risks
- Examples: Undocumented immigrants felt government surveillance is inescapable; women transitioning from incarceration felt they have "nothing to lose"

2. Non-use
- Response: Not using technology, deleting accounts
- Costs: Opportunity loss, exclusion, silencing, isolation
- Example: Economically disadvantaged populations lose opportunities due to non-use of technologies

3. Withholding Disclosure
- Response: Self-censorship, information removal  
- Costs: Restricts self-expression, silencing
- Examples: Low-SES youth, marginalized Cambodians, and political refugees self-censored to avoid conflict but were further silenced; men who have sex with men may not disclose HIV status but inadvertently signal it

4. Controlling Disclosure
- Response: Compartmentalizing identity, multiple accounts, privacy controls, segmenting audiences
- Costs: Restricts self-expression, labor-intensive, social/financial costs
- Examples: Trans men crowdfunding surgery used privacy controls; young Azerbaijanis maintained multiple accounts for activism; LGBTQ+ social media users managed identities across platforms

5. Privacy Lies
- Response: Providing false information
- Costs: Cognitive burden, social/legal repercussions
- Examples: Rural Appalachians provided false information as vigilanteism; South Asian women provided false information to protect from abuse

6. Privacy-Enhancing Technologies
- Response: Authentication, cloaking, encryption
- Costs: Social liability, erasure of records
- Examples: Women in patriarchal societies used private modes and locks which may be seen as incriminating; financially insecure people losing access to two-factor authentication

7. Physical Workarounds
- Response: Hiding device, camera covers, headphones
- Costs: Limits environmental awareness, vulnerable to physical coercion
- Example: People with visual impairments used headphones to avoid aural eavesdropping at cost of physical safety

8. Asking for Help 
- Response: Learning practices, consulting network/websites/professionals
- Costs: Bad information, involves risk/trust, limited to help available
- Examples: IPV professionals not equipped to advise on technology-enabled abuse; visually impaired people risking trust with allies

9. Collaborative Privacy Practices
- Response: Shared guidelines, boundaries
- Costs: Loss of autonomy, involves risk/trust
- Examples: LGBTQ+ adults considering family boundaries; families co-developing privacy guidelines in Bangladesh

10. Third-Party Protections
- Response: Parents removing devices, organizations destroying info
- Costs: Loss of autonomy, outside control
- Examples: Art therapists removing identifying dementia patient information; Canadian government destroying colonial abuse records

High-Level Privacy Tensions:

1. Privacy vs. Identity Disclosure
- Tension between using technology requiring identity disclosure and facing threats
- Example: LGBTQ+ social media users connecting while risking stigma from unintended audiences

2. Privacy vs. Support
- Tension between seeking support and disclosing vulnerabilities 
- Examples: Low income people identifying themselves for state benefits; trans men crowdfunding surgery requiring public disclosures

3. Privacy vs. Autonomy
- Tension between surveillance for safety and invasion of privacy
- Example: VSP shelters surveilling trafficking survivors' communications; location tracking for dementia patients

4. Individual vs. Collective
- Tension between individual and group privacy interests
- Example: LGBTQ+ parents' disclosures affecting their network's privacy boundaries
