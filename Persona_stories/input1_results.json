She uses the Music App on the shared family computer late at night to listen to curated ‘coping playlists’ and podcasts from a domestic violence support service. High-level privacy tensions: Privacy vs. Support (wants emotional support playlists but fears family discovery), Privacy vs. Identity Disclosure (must hide her trauma-related listening). Her typical privacy responses include compartmentalizing her identity by using a separate app account and self-censoring her public profile; the cost is extra cognitive burden and risk of discovery if settings leak.",
