Create user personas that take into account privacy issues faced by individuals who are either vulnerable, marginalized, or both.
Each persona should include the following components:

üîπ Basic Persona Info
Name; Age; Tech comfort level

üîπ Contextual Persona Info
Use the following typology of marginalization contexts, along with REFERENCE to the common denominators and characteristics of vulnerability and/or vulnerable populations, to guide contextual persona construction.
**Types of Marginalization Contexts:
(1) Individuals and identities (specific marginalized identities)
(2) Physical spaces and communities (marginalization at the level of communities)
(3) Online spaces, tools, and communities (marginalized groups use to protect their privacy online or communities in which marginalized people participate)
(4) Marginalization in General

- Questions to consider:
1. What type(s) of marginalization does this persona experience?
2. What is the persona's level of privacy awareness when using technology?
3. What types of personal information does the persona care about controlling while using technology?

üîπ Privacy Responses and Costs
** Use the REFERENCE sections 'Privacy Responses and Costs' and 'High-level privacy-related tensions and trade-offs' below to identify the persona's privacy behaviors. Address the following:
1. What privacy tensions arise when the persona responds to perceived privacy threats?
2. What specific privacy responses they take or wish they could take?
3. What are the specific costs and consequences of different responses to these threats?

REFERENCE: 'Common Denominators and Characteristics of Vulnerability and/or Vulnerable Populations'
Usually vulnerability and/or vulnerable populations concerns people who do not enjoy full physical, psychological and social well-being, and as a result are (at risk of) falling behind in society or become socially isolated.
Some common characteristics include:
(1) accumulation of problems or limitations (multi-complex problems); 
(2) feelings of powerlessness and distrust; 
(3) disrupted communication; 
(4) limited or no access to resources; 
(5) marginality; 
(6) imbalance in burden and capacity; 
(7) dependency situation; 
(8) low self-esteem

REFERENCE: 'Privacy Responses and Costs'

1. Privacy Response: Apathy (i.e. lack of response)
   Cost/Consequence: Exposure to risks
   Examples: Undocumented immigrants felt government surveillance is inescapable;  leading to inaction; women transitioning from incarceration felt they have ‚Äúnothing to lose‚Äù

2. Privacy Response: Non-use (e.g. not using a technology, deleting an account)
   Cost/Consequence: Opportunity loss; Exclusion; Silencing; Isolation
   Examples: Economically disadvantaged populations lose opportunities due to non-use of technologies

3. Privacy Response: Withholding disclosure (e.g. self-censorship, information removal)
   Cost/Consequence: Restricts self-expression; Silencing
   Examples: Low-SES youth, marginalized Cambodians, and political refugees in the U.S. self-censored to avoid conflict and danger but were further silenced by doing so. Men who have sex with men may not disclose HIV status on dating apps but can inadvertently signal positive status.

4. Privacy Response: Controlling disclosure (e.g. compartmentalizing identity, multiple accounts, privacy controls, segmenting audiences)
   Cost/Consequence: Restricts self-expression; Labor-intensive; Social cost; Financial cost
   Examples: Trans men crowdfunding top surgery used privacy controls to limit audiences, young Azerbaijanis maintained multiple accounts for political activism, and LGBTQ+ social media users managed identities across platforms. Disclosure controls require extensive labor and restrict self-expression. Complex privacy controls can be costly to access and can be used incorrectly due to accessibility issues.

5. Privacy Response: Privacy Lies (i.e. providing false information)
   Cost/Consequence: Cognitive burden; Social/legal repercussions
   Examples: Rural Appalachians provided false information as a form of vigilanteism; South Asian women provided false information to protect themselves from online abuse.

6. Privacy Response: Privacy-enhancing technologies (e.g., authentication, cloaking, encryption)
   Cost/Consequence: Social liability; Erasure of records
   Examples: Women in patriarchal societies used private modes and locks on devices, which may be seen as incriminating and invite coercion to obtain access. People who are financially insecure who lose access to trusted devices lose access to services that require two-factor authentication.

7. Privacy Response: Physical workarounds (e.g. hiding device, use of camera covers & headphones)
   Cost/Consequence: Limits environmental awareness; Vulnerable to physical coercion
   Examples: People with visual impairments used headphones to avoid aural eavesdropping when using screen readers at the cost of physical safety.

8. Privacy Response: Asking for help (e.g. learning new practices, consulting network, websites, professionals) 
   Cost/Consequence: Bad information; Involves risk/trust; Limited to help available
   Examples: Professionals who provide support for survivors of intimate partner violence did not feel equipped to advise on identifying or coping with technology-enabled IPV. People with visual impairments asked allies for help, but this risked trusting the ally with personal information.

9. Privacy Response: Collaborative privacy practices (e.g. shared guidelines, boundaries)
   Cost/Consequence: Loss of autonomy; Involves risk/trust
   Examples: LGBTQ+ adults considered not only their own privacy boundaries but also those of their families, ex-partners, and children. Families co-developed privacy guidelines for shared devices in Bangladesh.

10. Privacy Response: Third-party protections (e.g. parents removing devices, organizations destroying info)
    Cost/Consequence: Loss of autonomy; Outside of the person‚Äôs control
    Examples: Art therapists removed identifying information from art created by persons with dementia to protect their privacy, but this also removed their voice. Canadian government‚Äôs legal decision to destroy data documenting colonial abuses of indigenous people to protect their personal privacy also erased evidence of their abuse.

REFERENCE: 'High-level privacy-related tensions and trade-offs'

1. Privacy vs. Disclosure of identity
Definition: Most uses of technology entail some degree of identity disclosure. For marginalized groups, the privacy threats associated with everyday use may be acute, even if the groups themselves are not cognizant of the threats.
Example: LGBTQ social media users may use platforms to connect and explore their identity but also risk stigma from unintended audiences

2. Privacy vs. Support
Definition: Marginalized groups by definition experience some form of stress, support seeking is particularly salient. Receiving support comes with the risk of exposing vulnerabilities.
Examples: Low income and marginalized people often ‚Äúare the people who most need benefits from the state, and to receive benefits, they must identify themselves,‚Äù which can introduce risk of stigma and persecution; For trans men who crowdfund financial support for top surgery, support-seeking can entail highly public disclosures.

3. Privacy vs. Autonomy 
Definition: Privacy is an important way of protecting individuals‚Äô freedoms. As such, oversight of others‚Äô location, well-being, or activities is often paternalistic or invasive. But in some cases, surveillance were used to facilitate autonomy. The limits of privacy and the acceptable privacy for safety and wellbeing need to be trade-offs.
Example: In the work of victim service providers (VSPs). These organizations support survivors of human trafficking. In order to help ensure that survivors of human trafficking are not revictimized and in a direct bid to protect survivors‚Äô freedoms, VSP shelters may surveil communications, particularly of minors, to enforce rules and monitor for risky behaviors. 

4. Individual vs. Collective
Definition: Although privacy theorists often weigh the interests of the individual against those of states and organizations, in some cases, privacy concerns are collective. That is, more than one person may work together to protect the shared privacy interests of a group.
Example: LGBTQ+ parents on social media find that their privacy depends not only on their own disclosure decisions but also the disclosures and behaviors of their network. Further, their self-disclosures can also impact the privacy boundaries of those who make up their network, such as their children, partners, and former partners, and potentially expose the network to stigmatization as well.
