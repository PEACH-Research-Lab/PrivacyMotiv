An acquaintance from her conservative hometown, who had recently synced their Facebook account and followed her, screenshots and shares it in a private Discord group mocking her identity. Lina didn’t realize that sharing her activity would retroactively make real-time plays visible to mutuals, especially if they had already followed her via other linked accounts.",
