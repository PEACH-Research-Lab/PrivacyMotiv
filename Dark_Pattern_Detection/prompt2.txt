Given the design brief of a user flow, a user flow and a dark pattern taxonomy, your task is to analyze the given user flow for potential dark patterns. For all three levels taxonomy, if any are present, pay close attention to where the dark pattern appears, what the dark pattern is (at each level: high, meso, and low), and why you believe it is a dark pattern. You are only allowed to match low-level patterns to their corresponding parent meso-level patterns, and match meso-level patterns to their corresponding parent high-level patterns, as defined below. Do not misassign them to where it does not belong to.

Dark pattern taxonomy：
High-level patterns include general strategies that can be employed through a range of modalities and technologies and application types.
Meso-level patterns describe a context-agnostic angle of attack and may be interpreted in relations to context based on the specific modality or application type.
Low-level patterns are situated and contextually dependent, including specific means of execution

1: High-level pattern: Sneaking
Definition: Sneaking is a strategy which hides, disguises, or delays the disclosure of important information that, if made available to users, would cause a user to unintentionally take an action they would likely object to.

1.1: Meso-level patterns: Bait and Switch
Definition: Bait and Switch subverts the user’s expectation that their choice will result in a desired action, instead leading to an unexpected, undesirable outcome.
1.1.1: Low-level patterns: Disguised Ads
Definition: Disguised Ads Bait and Switch and use Sneaking to style interface elements so they are not clearly marked as an advertisement or other biased source. As a result, users are induced into clicking on the interface element because they assume that it is a relevant and salient interaction, leading to unwitting interaction with advertising content.

1.2: Meso-level patterns: Hiding Information
Definition: Hiding Information subverts the user’s expectation that all relevant information to make an informed choice will be available to them, instead hiding information or delaying the disclosure of information until later in the user journey that may have led to them making another choice.
1.2.1: Low-level patterns: Sneak into Basket
Definition: Sneak into Basket Hides Information and uses Sneaking to add unwanted items to a user’s shopping cart without their consent. As a result, a user assumes that only the items they explicitly added to their cart will be purchased, leading to unintentional purchase of additional items.
1.2.2: Low-level patterns: Drip Pricing, Hidden Costs, or Partitioned Pricing
Definition: Drip Pricing, Hidden Costs, or Partitioned Pricing Hides Information and uses Sneaking to reveal new charges or costs, present only partial price components,  or otherwise delay revealing the full price of a product or service  through late or incomplete disclosure. As a result, the user is misled about the total or complete price of the product or service, leading to them to make a purchase decision after they have expended effort on false pretenses.
1.2.3: Low-level patterns: Reference Pricing
Definition: Reference Pricing Hides Information and uses Sneaking to include a misleading or inaccurate price for a product or service that makes a discounted price appear more attractive. As a result, the user is misled into believing that the price they pay is discounted, leading them to make a decision to purchase a product or service on false pretenses.

1.3: Meso-level patterns: (De)contextualizing Cues
Definition: (De)contextualizing Cues subverts the user’s expectation that provided information will guide the user to making an informed choice, instead confusing the user and/or preventing them from locating relevant information due to the context where information is presented.
1.3.1: Low-level patterns: Conflicting Information
Definition: Conflicting Information uses (De)contextualizing Cues and Sneaking to include two or more sources of information that conflict with each other. As a result, the user is unsure what the consequences of their actions will be and will be more likely to accept default settings that may not be in their best interest.
1.3.2: Low-level patterns: Information without Context
Definition: Information without context uses (De)contextualizing Cues and Sneaking to alter the relevant information or user controls to limit discoverability. As a result, the user is unlikely to find the information or action possibility they are interested in.

Please return your analysis in JSON format using the following structure:
{
  "user_flow_title": "Viewing Friend Activity on the Music App",
  "dark_patterns_in_this_flow": [
    {
      "dark_pattern_location": "start/step1/step2/step3/…",
      "action": "",
      "interface": "",
      "dark_patterns": [

          "meso_level_pattern": "",
          "reasoning": ""
        },
        {

          "reasoning": ""
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
If a certain level of dark pattern does not apply to a step, simply omit that level from the list in that step. You may include multiple entries under dark_patterns_in_this_flow if multiple steps in the flow contain different dark patterns.
