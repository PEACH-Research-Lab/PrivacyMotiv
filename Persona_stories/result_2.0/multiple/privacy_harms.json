The system (data sender) began broadcasting her listening habits without clearly informing her of the consequences. Leila assumed she could view others' data without reciprocating, revealing a lack of meaningful choice and powerlessness over her personal data visibility."

The vague interface and lack of immediate, visible consequences resulted in her making a decision without being properly informed, impairing her ability to make an autonomous, privacy-conscious choice."

However, the system (data sender) broadcasted this to all mutual contacts who had enabled visibility, including a distant classmate (data recipient) who later referenced it. This violated her expectation of privacy and control, as she did not consent to this specific form of disclosure."

The inappropriate data sharing triggered a panic episode, exacerbating her existing emotional vulnerability tied to racial trauma and social isolation."
