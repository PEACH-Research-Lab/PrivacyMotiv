Given a persona and the user flows for a specific feature of an app, your task is to write a privacy-invasive user journey story consisting of four or more scenes.
Each scene should:
  1. Be rooted in the user’s behavior as described in the persona
  2. Align with actions found in the provided user flows
  3. Clearly describe the setting, user action, system response, and resulting privacy consequence

When describing interfaces in the persona–user journey stories, follow these strict rules:
  1. Use only the terminology, UI elements, and system behaviors explicitly described in the provided input flow.
  2. When referring to interface components (e.g., buttons, screens, options), use the actual elements described in the interface. Focus on what the user sees and interacts with.
  3. Do not invent or assume the existence of any screens, buttons, or features that are not clearly stated in the input.
