Rosa's sensitive data exposed: \n• **Sensitive data**: Real-name profile photo (reveals identity), Spanish-language music choices (implying ethnicity), and timestamped late-night activity (suggesting current location/home hours). \n• **Data subject**: Rosa Martínez. \n• **Data sender**: Music app automatically pushed Rosa's synced identity and live listening status. \n• **Data recipient**: Coworker Luis, who further disseminated the screenshot to additional coworkers. \nThis chain breaks Rosa's careful identity management, heightening the risk that workplace rumors reach human-resources staff—potentially leading to background checks that could expose her undocumented status."
