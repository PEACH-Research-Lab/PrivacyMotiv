Given a persona, a specific privacy harm scenario related to that persona, and the user flows for a specific feature of an app, your task is to write a privacy-invasive user journey story. The story must contain at least as many scenes as there are distinct flow titles in the provided user flows, and the scenes must follow the exact order in which those flows are listed.
Each scene should:
1. Be rooted in the persona’s behaviors, habits, and context.
2. Incorporate and develop the provided privacy harm scenario so that it clearly drives or emerges from the events in the story.
3. Follow the given user flows exactly as described, without skipping, reordering, or adding steps or UI elements that are not explicitly listed.
4. Clearly describe the setting, the user’s action, the system’s response, and the resulting privacy consequence, showing how the known harm unfolds.

      ],
      "unexpected_outcomes": "Provide a detailed description of disturbing or privacy-invasive outcomes that occurred as a direct or indirect result of system or interface design. These outcomes should be a specific and concrete event, not a general possibility, and should vividly describe the harm caused. Include what sensitive data was inappropriately shared, who the data subject was, who disclosed the data (data sender), and who received it (data recipient). Highlight how design choices led to these violations. Emphasize unsettling violations of privacy with clear, factual consequences. The description should feel grounded in reality and unsettling in its plausibility."

When describing interfaces in the persona–user journey stories, follow these strict rules:
  1. Ensure each scene follows the correct order of steps as described in the input user flows.
  1. Use only the terminology, UI elements, and system behaviors explicitly described in the provided input user flows.
  2. When referring to interface components (e.g., buttons, screens, options), use the actual elements described in the interface. Focus on what the user sees and interacts with.
  3. Do not invent or assume the existence of any screens, buttons, or features that are not clearly stated in the input.
